            <h1>Background</h1>
            <p>
                My education and related experience have given me a strong background in the field of web development, user experience, gamification, and artificial intelligence.  <br /> <br />Earlier, I was developing various mixed reality games at a gaming company in Switzerland. I was participating in the development of mixed reality games such as a location-based predatory game and a golf game which users could play in the real world with their mobile phone. 
                Also, Iâ€™ve had participated in a project regarding mobile-based field trips for world heritage sites in collaboration with a department of education. <br /> <br />
                Currently, I am doing my career as a software engineer in Germany. I am always eager to learn new technologies and I deeply interested in functional programming and financial technology.
